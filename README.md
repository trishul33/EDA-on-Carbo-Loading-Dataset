EDA on Carbo Loading Dataset from Kroger
The purpose of this project is to perform data analysis and visualization on the Carbo-Loading data set. Carbo-Loading contains household level transactions over a period of two years from four categories: Pasta, Pasta Sauce, Syrup, and Pancake Mix. These categories were chosen so that interactions between the categories can be detected and studied.
